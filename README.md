# SAM Samples

SAM is [a new reactive functional pattern](http://sam.js.org) which greatly simplifies the architecture of front-ends (native or Web).

This repo focuses on Vanilla JS and Node.js implementations. It contains the following samples:

* admin-template - an Angular2 admin template modified to implement the SAM pattern 
* aws-alexa samples show how the SAM pattern can be used to implement Alexa skills
* Blog - a simple CRUD implementation showing how easy it is to create isomorphic implementations with SAM (vanilla.js +/- node.js)
* Hash-DOM - an unapologetic minimalist v-dom equivalent that works well with the SAM pattern
* Inferno - the rocket sample with an [Inferno](https://github.com/trueadm/inferno) based view
* React - counter is a boilerplate SAM implementation in React, child-instance demonstrates how a Parent/Child implementation works, and the Spinner sample shows how a view component can initiate/control a spinner
* SB-Admin - a simple Web application based on the SB Admin template (node.js with no client-side code)
* TODOMVC - an implementation of the [TODOMVC](http://www.todomvc.com) challenge (vanilla.js)
* Vanilla-ES6-boilerplate-project - This is a starter project for people who do not want to use a framwork
